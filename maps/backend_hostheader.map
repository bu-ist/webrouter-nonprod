# The values in this file override the default host header which is the Host header that NGINX received ($host).
#
# There should be very few entries in this file as the default works well for most things.
#
# Most entries in this file will be of form:
# 
# backend_name $backend_hostname ;
#
# This will set the header to the backend/upstream hostname.  This is necessary for all 
# S3 buckets.
#
s3bucket $backend_hostname ;

# This test entry is to a fixed value to simplify the test scripts

#checkhostheader $backend_hostname ;

# There are 3 backend types for the homepage in S3.
# 
# The normal bucket
aws_home $backend_hostname ;

# These backends map to specific URLs and need to be hardcoded
